# slp_tools
Tools for automating SLP practices 

# Current tooling

## Timesheets 
We offer a method for computing SLP timesheets containing different methods of work (direct/indirect) and further classification within these categories.
By submitting a text file delimited by newlines containing information about the work done at each stage of the day, we compute the timecard for a given week.

# On the Horizon
We will be adding more functionality, including NLP-integrations for morpheme-counting, etc.
We will be adding a cleaner interface to the tooling as well.
